      <h3>Genesis 16</h3>
      <h4 class="passage-heading">Sarai and Hagar</h4>
      <p class="passage-paragraph"><sup>[1]</sup> Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. <sup>[2]</sup> And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children<sub><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">(1)</a></sub> by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. <sup>[3]</sup> So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife. <sup>[4]</sup> And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.<sub><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">(2)</a></sub> <sup>[5]</sup> And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!” <sup>[6]</sup> But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.</p>
      <p class="passage-paragraph"><sup>[7]</sup> The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. <sup>[8]</sup> And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.” <sup>[9]</sup> The angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her.” <sup>[10]</sup> The angel of the LORD also said to her, “I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.” <sup>[11]</sup> And the angel of the LORD said to her,</p>
      <p class="passage-paragraph">“Behold, you are pregnant<br>        and shall bear a son.<br>    You shall call his name Ishmael,<sub><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">(3)</a></sub><br>        because the LORD has listened to your affliction.<br>    <sup>[12]</sup> He shall be a wild donkey of a man,<br>        his hand against everyone<br>        and everyone’s hand against him,<br>    and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.”<br>    <br>    <br>      <sup>[13]</sup> So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God of seeing,”<sub><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">(4)</a></sub> for she said, “Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.”<sub><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">(5)</a></sub> <sup>[14]</sup> Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi;<sub><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">(6)</a></sub> it lies between Kadesh and Bered.</p>
      <p class="passage-paragraph"><sup>[15]</sup> And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. <sup>[16]</sup> Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.</p>
